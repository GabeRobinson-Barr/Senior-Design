Physics
- Cubes and Spheres implemented
- Forces applied based on object collisions
- Movable and immovable objects
- Drag and gravity applies to player only

Collision
- Object to object collision checks
- Octree data structure for accellerating collision checking
- Elastic and Inelastic collisions

Other
- Grappeling hook the player can use to pull themselves to objects
- Respawning if the player falls below the stage

Controls
- WASD, Basic movement forward, backwards, strafe left, strafe right
- Arrow Keys, Rotate left, rotate right, look up, look down
